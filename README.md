# Advising_Help_Discord_bot
Extra but must work: Create a ".env" file with "DISCORD_TOKEN=" after equal put the token from Discord bot/developer website.
When done use "/course <course_code>" in Discord to find the faculties with available seats. For example: "/course CSE111" will show only the faculties(of CSE111) with available seats. It will provide Course & Section, Faculty Initial, Class Time, Lab Time, Exam Date, and Number of Available Seats. You can make your routine that way. (The course code is not case-sensitive.)
